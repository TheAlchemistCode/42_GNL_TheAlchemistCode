# get_next_line

## Overview

`get_next_line` is a C function designed to read a file descriptor line by line, returning each line with every call. This is a common coding challenge in C programming, especially in the 42 school curriculum, as it tests understanding of memory management, buffer handling, and efficient file I/O.

## How It Works
- **Line-by-Line Reading:** Each call to `get_next_line(fd)` returns the next line from the file descriptor `fd`, including the newline character if present.
- **Buffer Management:** The function uses a buffer to read chunks of data, efficiently handling files of any size.
- **Memory Safety:** All memory allocations are carefully managed to avoid leaks and ensure stability.
- **No Static Limits:** The function does not impose arbitrary limits on line length or file size.

## Key Features
- Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Returns `NULL` when the end of file is reached or on error.
- Uses custom utility functions for string manipulation and memory allocation.

## Improvements Over the Old Version
Comparing the new `.c` files to the old ones, several improvements have been made:

- **Enhanced Memory Management:** The new version includes more robust checks for memory allocation failures and integer overflows (e.g., in `ft_calloc`).
- **Cleaner String Functions:** Utility functions like `ft_strjoin`, `ft_strchr`, and `ft_strlen` are more concise and handle edge cases better (such as `NULL` inputs).
- **Safer Buffer Handling:** The new implementation ensures that buffers are always properly null-terminated and avoids potential buffer overflows.
- **Code Readability:** The code is more modular and easier to read, making it more maintainable and accessible for future improvements.
- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling throughout the code, returning `NULL` or `0` in case of errors or overflows, which prevents undefined behavior.

## Why This Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Proficiency in C and low-level programming.
- Strong understanding of memory management and error handling.
- Ability to refactor and improve existing code for safety, efficiency, and readability.
